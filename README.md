# üè¢‚õ∫ Small gatherings

## Hyperlocal meetups for affected institutions

Small gatherings is a web app that finds small groups of people from your class or team who live nearby, then connects you up so you can do remote work or remote learning together.

The goal is to gradually rebuild institutions in cities that have lifted quarantines / lockdowns, but aren't ready to permit large gatherings.

The live app is hosted at [smallgatherings.app](https://smallgatherings.app).

## üö® Be careful and considerate

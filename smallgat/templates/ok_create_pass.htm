<h3>Account created</h3>
<p>Thanks! That did the trick.</p>
<p>Now <a href="{{url_for('auth.get_login')}}">log in</a> with the account you just created to make sure it worked.</p>
<p>We sent a verification check to your email as well -- you'll have to click it before you can perform most actions on the site.</p>

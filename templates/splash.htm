  <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
  <p>Ask your school or office to create an institution page.</p>
  <p>While you're at it, create a personal account.</p>
  <p>When you get the institution link, first make sure that it's from a trusted source, then attach yourself to the institution and wait to get placed.</p>

  <p>For now, the author is self-funding.</p>
  <p>If this grows and gets expensive, we'll add a $1 fee to create an institution, which will be used to cover hosting expenses and to create a paper trail for institutions. The excess will be donated to virus research or treatment.</p>
  <p>If we add a fee, we'll publish all income, costs and donations on this site.<p>

  <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
  <p>Ask your school or office to create an institution page.</p>
  <p>While you're at it, create a personal account.</p>
  <p>When you get the institution link, first make sure that it's from a trusted source, then attach yourself to the institution and wait to get placed.</p>

  <h3>Who pays for this?</h3>
  <p>For now, the author is self-funding.</p>
  <p>We're going to introduce a small fee to create an institution (1 dollar), which will be used to cover hosting expenses and to create a paper trail for institutions. The excess will be donated to virus research or treatment.</p>
  <p>Once we start the 1 dollar fee, we'll track all income, costs and donations on this site.<p>
